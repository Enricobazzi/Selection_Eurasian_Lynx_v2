# Signatures of selection in the Eurasian lynx

In this project I will analyze signatures of positive selection in the Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx).

I will build on what was already done previously within another project (Selection_Eurasian_Lynx), reorganizing the scripts I already wrote and run, and writing new ones for the analyses that are left to be done.

This readme and the folders of this project are organized in different sections:

1. Preparing Genetic Data
2. Preparing Environmental Data
3. Identifying Candidate Loci
